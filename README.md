# Mycological Rationality

This is the repository for the data and data analysis (R) for the article "Mycological Rationality: Heuristics, Perception and Decision-Making in Mushroom Foraging".

The dataset for the survey (anonymous) is stored in mushroom.csv. Two .txt files are also stored; these are only for text mining purposes and can otherwise be ignored. Reproducible R code is available in mushroom.r.
