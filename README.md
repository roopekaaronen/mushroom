# Mycological Rationality

This is the repository for the data and data analysis (R) for the article "Mycological Rationality: Heuristics, Perception and Decision-Making in Mushroom Foraging".

Survey data is stored (fully anonymised) in mushroom.csv. Two .txt files (for text mining) are also stored with responses to the image recognition tasks. Reproducible R code is available in mushroom.r.
