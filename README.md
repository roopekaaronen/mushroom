# Mycological Rationality

This is the repository for the data and data analysis (R) for the article "Mycological Rationality: Heuristics, Perception and Decision-Making in Mushroom Foraging", to be published in Judgment and Decision Making in September 2020.

The dataset for the survey (anonymous) is stored in mushroom.csv. Two .txt files are also stored; these are only for text mining purposes and can otherwise be ignored. Reproducible R code is available in mushroom.r.

The following is a legend for interpreting the .csv file variables (variables in *italics*):
***
*Age*: Age of respondent
*Gender*: Female (F), Male (M), or Other.
*Experience_years*: Self-reported mushroom foraging experience in years.
*Species*: Self-reported number of mushroom species foraged for during an average foraging trip.

The following eight variables are responded to on a five-point Likert scale (1-5; Completely disagree to Completely agree).

*Hunch*: When I go mushroom foraging, I have a strong hunch of which mushrooms I expect to find.
*Heuristics*: I often make use of rules of thumb when I forage.
*Glance*: With a quick glance of a given terrain, I know which mushrooms could grow in the area.
*Apaja*: I keep the knowledge of bountiful mushroom hunting patches (“apaja”) to myself or my close ones.
*Experience*: I consider myself an experienced mushroom forager.
*Familiar*: I mainly forage in familiar terrain.
*Protect*: I would rather protect a forest where I forage than other forests which I visit.
*Delicious*: If I search for a specific delicious or precious species of mushroom, I don’t pick other species.

Variables *"Parents,Grandparents,OtherRelatives,Books,Internet,Course,Other"* are responses to the question "Who or where did you learn to forage from? (Select all that apply.)"

Variables *"FunHobby,Food,ResearchOrScience,Relax,NatureExperience,Exercise,SocialActivity"* are responses to the question "Why do you forage? (Select all that apply.)"

*SpeciesPicture1*: Response to the question “What mushroom species would you search for in the terrain in this picture?” for Figure 10.
*SpeciesPicture2*: Response to the question “What mushroom species would you search for in the terrain in this picture?” for Figure 11.

The following three variables include my *codes* with which I coded the qualitative dataset. They will be difficult to interpret, although you will note that they match to specific foraging strategies in Tables 4-6. Please contact me if you wish to understand them more specifically. 

*Reported_Heuristics1*: Answer to "What rules of thumb do you use pertaining to safe foraging?"
*Reported_Heuristics2*: Answer to "What rules of thumb do you use pertaining to the identification of edible or poisonous mushrooms?"
*Reported_Heuristics3*: Answer to "What rules of thumb do you use pertaining to identifying good foraging patches or finding mushrooms?"
